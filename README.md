## Comprehensive Health Assessment

Adolescent health care maintenance visits are more than just a physical exam. Your doctor will take a comprehensive approach to your well-being, including assessing your **physical**, **emotional**, and **social health**. They'll check your growth and development, screen for potential health issues, and offer guidance on staying healthy.


### Sexual and reproductive health:

As a teenager, you'll begin to explore your sexuality and develop relationships. Your doctor will provide information on sexual and reproductive health, such as contraception, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and safe sex practices. They'll also answer any questions you may have about your body, puberty, and your developing sexuality.


### Mental health screenings:

Mental health is a crucial part of your overall well-being. During your adolescent health care visit, your doctor may screen you for depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns. They'll ask you questions about your mood, behavior, and any issues that might be affecting your daily life. If needed, they may refer you to a mental health professional for further evaluation and support.


### Substance use discussions:

Your doctor will ask you about your use of alcohol, tobacco, and other substances during your visit. They'll provide guidance on the risks and consequences of substance use, and discuss ways to make healthy choices. Remember, your conversation with your doctor is confidential, and they are there to support you in making the best decisions for your health.


## You are encouraged to talk directly to your pediatrician.

If you came in with a parent or an adult guardian, the doctor will ask them to step out of the room in order to have a confidential conversation with you. You can consider this a “safe space” to talk about anything health-related with your doctor. Click here for more information about this confidential conversation.


    **_More focus on your independence_**: One of the main differences between pediatric and adolescent health care visits is the increased focus on your independence. As you grow older, you're expected to become more responsible for your health. Your doctor will encourage you to take an active role in making decisions about your care, such as asking questions, discussing concerns, and understanding your medical history.


    **_Privacy matters_**: Privacy becomes a priority during your adolescent healthcare visits. Your doctor will typically talk to you one-on-one, without a parent or guardian in the room. This allows you to discuss sensitive topics that you may not feel comfortable talking about in front of your parents, such as substance use, mental health, or sexual activity. It's important to know that your conversations with your doctor are confidential unless there's a safety concern that needs to be addressed with a parent or guardian.

## Adolescent vaccines will be offered.

You had a long break from receiving vaccines from your pediatrician. Aside from the yearly flu vaccine, you will be receiving HPV, Meningitis A, and Meningitis B vaccines. Click below for more information about these vaccines.


### HPV



* _Who_: Recommended for boys and girls starting from age 11 or 12, although it can be given as early as age 9.
* _What_: This is the first vaccine that can protect us from cancer! This vaccine helps protect against certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer, throat cancer, and genital warts.
* _Why_: These are conditions that you don’t have to worry about now but also don’t want to worry about later in the future. HPV is a very common virus that we do not routinely test. And because it’s a virus, there is no treatment. The best way is to prevent these diseases.
* _How_: Usually given as a series of 2 or 3 shots over 6 to 12 months.


### MENINGITIS A



* _Who_: Required for boys and girls at 11 to 12 years, with a booster shot at 16 years.
* _What & Why_: A vaccine that protects against meningococcal disease, which can cause serious infections in the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and the bloodstream, helping you prevent potentially severe or deadly illness.
* _How_: It's usually a single shot, with a booster dose for added protection.


### MENINGITIS B



* _Who_: Recommended for teens and young adults 16 through 23 years old, preferably at 16 through 18 years old.
* _Special Consideration_: This vaccine is highly recommended for those going to college and living in a dorm, military recruits, those with sickle cell disease or complement deficiency, and sexually active teens, especially males who have sex with males.
* _What & Why_: This vaccine specifically protects against meningococcal group B disease, a type of bacteria that can cause serious infections including meningitis. This is a rare condition, but if you catch it, it can be deadly.
* _How_: Given as a series of 2 shots, at least one month apart.


### FLU VACCINE

* _Who_: Recommended yearly for everyone 6 months of age and older, including teenagers.
* _What & Why_: A vaccine that helps protect against the Flu, which can cause serious illness and complications. This vaccine helps you stay healthy and avoid flu-related issues. If you think you don’t see people getting the Flu anymore, guess why? That’s because people are taking the Flu vaccine!
* _Disclaimer_: Some people may develop a fever or feel slightly sick a day or two after the shot. This is normal…and trust us, actually getting the Flu will be so much worse and you might end up in the hospital if you catch it.
* _How_: Usually given as a single shot every year before the flu season starts or during the flu season, which is typically from October to March in the United States.


### FAQ

    **Why Do I Need Shots?**


    Missing a shot may not seem like a bad thing — nobody wakes up in the morning thinking they'd love to go out and get a jab in the arm. But there are good reasons to get shots:


    **One little "ouch" moment protects you from some major health problems.** For example, older teens and adults who get diseases like mumps may be at risk for side effects of the illness, such as infertility (the inability to have children).


    **Vaccinations are about protecting you in the future, not just as a kid.** Many of the diseases that we are vaccinated against when we're kids — like hepatitis B or tetanus — actually affect more adults than kids. Plus, anyone can get "kid diseases" like chickenpox, and they can be far more dangerous to teens and adults than they are to little kids.


    **Shots could even save your life.** Hepatitis B attacks the liver and can eventually kill. The HPV vaccine can protect against several types of cancer. And scientists are constantly working on new vaccines against deadly diseases like **[HIV](https://kidshealth.org/en/teens/std-hiv.html)**.
